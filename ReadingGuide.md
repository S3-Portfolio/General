# Learning outcomes
**1.	You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.**

Frontend and backend are connected.
Three user stories are done, an user can see which fish they can see per dive and I added search functions to the dive and fish pages.

[Back-end](https://github.com/S3-Portfolio/Back-end)

**2.	You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.**

Thinking about combining multiple tests. 
One of which will be a more analog way of testing. 
Namely; having a potential user test the website, by letting them act out the user-stories and writing down their opinions / experience.

**3.	You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.**

I have made a format of the canvas course, which I call "Management document".

**4.	You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.**

CI completed for frontend and backend.
Both frontend and backend are in Docker, but not deployed.

**5.	You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.**

I have written about cultural differences and ethics in my managament document as well as made a seperate document going into more detail about cultural differences and ethics. 

[Cultural differences and Ethics](https://github.com/S3-Portfolio/General/blob/6bf6a92955f02302a7a73e62fde58c0cbf7e6053/CulturalDifferencesEthics.md)

[Management document](https://github.com/S3-Portfolio/General/blob/14d07cd89692fb4bba18dfe995c76fb5ce441099/management.md)

**6.	You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.**

My choices and styling are in the "Design choices" document.
I have also added a achitecture model, although the model is not very complex.

My backend is C# / REST API / frontend React in JavaScript

**7.	You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.**

Have been working on both my analysis and management documents.
Both of these documents use a format that I created myself based on the courses in Canvas.

**8.	You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.**

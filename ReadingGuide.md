# Learning outcomes
**1.	You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications.**

Frontend and backend are connected.
Three user stories are done, an user can see which fish they can see per dive and I added search functions to the dive and fish pages.

[Front-end](https://github.com/S3-Portfolio/Front-end) /
[Back-end](https://github.com/S3-Portfolio/Back-end)

**2.	You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development.**

Thinking about combining multiple tests. 
One of which will be a more analog way of testing. 
Namely; having a potential user test the website, by letting them act out the user-stories and writing down their opinions / experience.
This will be a usability test.
The other type of test will be Integration tests.
I have already written a testplan for these and have written one in code.
I also have two front-end tests made with jest. One of them passes, but the other one fails.

**3.	You choose and implement the most suitable agile software development method for your software project.**

I have made a format of the canvas course, which I call "Management document".

[Management document](https://github.com/S3-Portfolio/General/blob/4250b9a3dfff75a9f058c93e1c141d429b1a0bab/management.md)

**4.	You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context.**

CI completed for frontend and backend.
Both frontend and backend are in Docker, but not deployed.
I have also been working on a Docker document.
This is meant for developers who want to run my Docker images on their desktop.

**5.	You recognize and take into account cultural differences between project stakeholders and ethical aspects in software development.**

I have written about cultural differences and ethics in a seperate document.
The parts about cultural differences and ethics that were first part of my management and analysis documents are also included.

[Cultural differences and Ethics](https://github.com/S3-Portfolio/General/blob/4250b9a3dfff75a9f058c93e1c141d429b1a0bab/CulturalDifferencesEthics.md)

**6.	You analyze (non-functional) requirements, elaborate (architectural) designs and validate them using multiple types of test techniques.**

My choices and styling are in the "Design choices" document.
I have also added the first two instances of a C4 model, although the model is not very complex.

In this image you can see the first instance of the C4 model.
This model doesn't use tecnical terms, as it is commonly shown to people without software knowledge.
Because my application isn't very complex, emulates the model the same. 
It simply shows how an user would interact with my system.

![C4_2 drawio](https://github.com/S3-Portfolio/General/assets/93527848/3709ec7b-f580-40c9-bbac-fd71aeb89eb8)

In this image you can see the second instance of the C4 model.
This model is commonly viewed by people with more software knowledge, so it goes more in depth than the first instance of the C4 model.
It shows how an user, my application, my database and my API communicate and/or interact with each other.
The arrows show the relation between.
Because my application isn't very complex, it wouldn't really add anything if I made the other instances of the C4 model.
I have therefor only made the first two instances. 
The first two instances are also the most common to be made, unless an application is very complex.

**7.	You analyze and describe simple business processes that are related to your project.**

I have been working on my analysis document.
This document uses a format that I created myself based on the courses in Canvas.

**8.	You act in a professional manner during software development and learning.**

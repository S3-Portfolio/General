####  What does it mean agile development, the agile manifesto, the agile principles?

Definition agile development: 
"Agile software development is an umbrella term for a set of frameworks and practices based on the values and principles expressed in the Manifesto for Agile Software Development and the 12 Principles behind it." 
[Source](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/)

Definition agile manifesto: 
"The Agile Manifesto is a brief document built on 4 values and 12 principles for agile software development."
[Source](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/agile-manifesto/)

Definition agile principles:
"The 12 agile principles can support businesses to streamline their product-development cycles and achieve better results through a flexible, reactive system."

#### Which agile methods exist and which are most popular?
Scrum, Lean Developmen (also commenly refered to as just Lean) and Kanban are a few examples of popular agile methods.
#### Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book?
Scrum is defined completely in the Scrum Guide by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the originators of Scrum. [Scrum guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide)

Scrum is based on empirical process control theory, which asserts that knowledge comes from experience and that decisions are made based on what is known.
The Scrum framework consists of three roles: the Product Owner, the Development Team, and the Scrum Master.
The Product Owner is responsible for the product backlog.
The Development Team is responsible for delivering an iteration of the product at the end of each sprint.
And the Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.

#### Can you explain two more agile methods and name a number of interesting features in them different from Scrum?
Kanban: Kanban is based on visualizing and managing work. It uses boards to track work items and their status during the stages of development; to-do, busy, up for review and done. Kanban is based on continuous delivery. 

The Kanban definition goes as follows: 
"The Kanban Method is a means to design, manage, and improve flow systems for knowledge work. The method also allows organizations to start with their existing workflow and drive evolutionary change. They can do this by visualizing their flow of work, limit work in progress (WIP) and stop starting and start finishing.

The Kanban Method gets its name from the use of kanban – visual signaling mechanisms to control work in progress for intangible work products."

Kanban has two types of principles; Change Management Principles and Service Delivery Principles.
The Change Management Principles revolve around the fact that Kanban is structured to address the human tendency to resist change and include;
* Start with what you do now – Understand current processes as they are actually practiced and respect existing roles, responsibilities and job titles.
* Agree to pursue improvement through evolutionary change
* Encourage acts of leadership at every level

The Service Delivery Principles acknowledge that organizations are a collection of interdependent services, and to place the focus on the work, not the people doing the work and include;
* Understand and focus on your customers’ needs and expectations
* Manage the work; let people self-organize around it
* Evolve policies to improve customer and business outcomes

Lean: Lean is similar to Kanban but it focusus on eliminating waste and obstructions to workflow. It is optimized for continuous learning and improvement. 

The Lean definition goes as follows:
"Lean or Lean management is a business approach for maximizing customer value while minimizing waste. It is based on the principles of the Toyota Production System (TPS) and aims to create a culture of continuous improvement in an organization. "

Lean has 5 management principles; Identify Value, Value Stream Mapping, Create a Continuous Workflow, Create a Pull System and Continuous Improvement.
* Identify Value: decide what you want to deliver, then move on to the next step.
* Value Stream Mapping: mapping the workflow of your company will show you where value is being generated and in what proportion different parts of the process do or do not produce value.
* Create a Continuous Workflow: to make sure that each team's workflow remains smooth by breaking down work into smaller batches and visualizing the workflow so you can easily detect and remove process roadblocks.
* Create a Pull System: work is pulled only if there is a demand for it. This lets you optimize resources’ capacity and deliver products or services only if there is an actual need.
* Continuous Improvement: the most important one, you need to make sure that employees on every level are involved in continuously improving the process. This can be done by (for example) doing a daily stand-up-meeting.

#### Do you know how software engineers work in practice with agile methods?
Software engineers work with agile methods in a collaborative, iterative, and adaptable way to deliver value to customers quickly and efficiently. 
Agile methods provide a structure for teams to work together and deliver high-quality software that meets customer needs.

#### Which agile management tool would you recommend for use in your project and why?
We were using a Trello as our kanban board.
Kanban worked quite well for our team. 
Git allows users to manage a primitive kanban board. Trello does not allow for full Kanban and or Scrum. 
Things like a burndown chart and user stories are missing in the tool. 
We therefore opted to change our agile management tool to YouTrack. 
YouTrack has a lot of features and lets us make burndown charts and user stories. 
It also provides more room for things like time estimates.

##### You have fully implemented an agile method in your project and demonstrated your expertise in it.
We have shown our teacher our Trello board and informed him when we switched to YouTrack. We have already shown a burnchart.

This is the burnchart that we showed our teacher. It isn't 100% acurate though, because it doesn't show when items were set to review. It only shows when items were sent to done.

##### You have selected an agile management tool of sufficient quality and have used it in your project to plan, report, and monitor your work.
We first used Trello in our group project for general planning and Discord for sprint planning and communication. 
Then we used YouTrack as our Agile management tool for general planning. For sprint planning and communication we use Discord and Whatsapp.

Exel board.

After completing a sprint using YouTrack as our Agile management tool, we encountered some issues with it. This was mainly because we were not familiar with YouTrack. We therefore opted for convenience and switched to using an Exel sheet rather than taking the time to firuge out YouTrack. We did this because we were running out of time and didn't want to "waste" any more time.

##### You have used relevant research methods like expert interviews, literature study, etc. in your study about agile software development.
When we encountered some problems with our planning and Trello wasn't working for us anymore, we researched some other agile management tool to come up with a solution. This eventually led to YouTrack. We have also explained to our teacher our thought process and reasoning for changing from Trello to YouTrack.

#### Management tool:
Our "agile" management tool is currently Exel. We first used YouTrack because it can make clear burndown charts and it is easy to give a time estimate to tasks and user stories.

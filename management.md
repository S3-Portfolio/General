#### Which agile methods exist and which are most popular?
Scrum, Lean Developmen (also commenly refered to as just Lean) and Kanban are a few examples of popular agile methods.
#### Can you explain Scrum in full details, as it is by the book?
Scrum is defined completely in the Scrum Guide by Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland, the originators of Scrum. [Scrum guide](https://www.scrum.org/resources/scrum-guide)

Scrum is based on empirical process control theory, which asserts that knowledge comes from experience and that decisions are made based on what is known.
The Scrum framework consists of three roles: the Product Owner, the Development Team, and the Scrum Master.
The Product Owner is responsible for the product backlog.
The Development Team is responsible for delivering an iteration of the product at the end of each sprint.
And the Scrum Master is responsible for promoting and supporting Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide.

#### Can you explain two more agile methods and name a number of interesting features in them different from Scrum?
Kanban: Kanban is based on visualizing and managing work. It uses boards to track work items and their status during the stages of development; to-do, busy, up for review and done. Kanban is based on continuous delivery. 

Lean: Lean is similar to Kanban but it focusus on eliminating waste and obstructions to workflow. It is optimized for continuous learning and improvement.

#### Do you know how software engineers work in practice with agile methods?
Software engineers work with agile methods in a collaborative, iterative, and adaptable way to deliver value to customers quickly and efficiently. 
Agile methods provide a structure for teams to work together and deliver high-quality software that meets customer needs.

#### Which agile management tool would you recommend for use in your project and why?
We were using a Trello as our kanban board.
Kanban worked quite well for our team. 
Git allows users to manage a primitive kanban board. Trello does not allow for full Kanban and or Scrum. 
Things like a burndown chart and user stories are missing in the tool. 
We therefore opted to change our agile management tool to YouTrack. 
YouTrack has a lot of features and lets us make burndown charts and user stories. 
It also provides more room for things like time estimates.

##### You have fully implemented an agile method in your project and demonstrated your expertise in it.
We have shown our teacher our Trello board and informed him when we switched to YouTrack. We have already shown a burnchart.

This is the burnchart that we showed our teacher. It isn't 100% acurate though, because it doesn't show when items were set to review. It only shows when items were sent to done.

##### You have selected an agile management tool of sufficient quality and have used it in your project to plan, report, and monitor your work.
We first used Trello in our group project for general planning and Discord for sprint planning and communication. 
Then we used YouTrack as our Agile management tool for general planning. For sprint planning and communication we use Discord and Whatsapp.

Exel board.

##### You have used relevant research methods like expert interviews, literature study, etc. in your study about agile software development.
When we encountered some problems with our planning and Trello wasn't working for us anymore, we researched some other agile management tool to come up with a solution. This eventually led to YouTrack. We have also explained to our teacher our thought process and reasoning for changing from Trello to YouTrack.

#### Management tool:
Our agile management tool is currently YouTrack. It can make clear burndown charts and it is easy to give a time estimate to tasks and user stories.

### Cultural differences
First and foremost: What is culture?

"Culture is a term that encompasses a wide range of social behaviors, institutions, norms, values, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities, and habits found in human societies."
[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture)

In regards to our group project there is a clear subject of cultural differences between the Dutch and Finnish students. 
And even within the Finnish group there are multiple cultures. 
This can have consequences for communication or decision making within the group. 

*“The Dutch are frank, blunt, no-nonsense people. 
They won’t pretend to like something just because they think it might offend you. 
On the one hand, it is very “refreshing”, as you will know exactly where you stand — but it can also come as a bit of a shock. 
It might seem a little harsh at first, but you should get used to it if you plan to spend any amount of time in the Netherlands.”*

*“Dutch Stubborness – There’s no more stoic people than the Dutch. 
… If a Dutchman has set his (or her) mind to something, it’s going to happen 
… refuse to accept common morality/ethics as the rest of the world and (thankfully!) stick to their own (gay marriage, soft drugs and so forth); 
most importantly – have you ever fought a Dutchman on any kind of issue they disagree with? 
It’s not just the frankness, you’d need a gun if not bigger to convince a Dutchie they’re wrong…”*

*“Finns have a reputation for reticence, thoughtfulness and unemotional behavior. 
They are quiet, reflective, somber and, for some, seemingly stubborn and standoffish. 
They are unwilling to speak unless they have something of importance to say. 
There is a saying that when a Finn says something, they really mean it.”*

From these citations it is apparent that Dutch people are stereotypically described as blunt and stubborn and Finnish people as quiet and standoffish. 
Of course most people are different and fall outside their stereotypes, but stereotypes established themselves for a reason. 

When only taking into account the stereotypes, it seems that there will not be a lot of conflict between groups; 
with the Dutch being blunt and pushing their ideas through and the Finnish quietly agreeing letting it all happen. 
But this should not be expected. 
Everyone is different and if we really are conforming to our stereotypes, than the Dutch should be more assertive towards the Finnish; 
ask their opinion, giving them time and a place to speak their mind. 
And the Finnish should be more vocal towards the Dutch. 

It should be stated that we have not encountered any problems (yet) with communication or decision making with the Finnish group and we hope it will stay this way throughout this project. 
This could partly be due to the fact that most of our communication has gone through two of the international students: someone from Austria and someone from France.
So the way these cultures communicate should also be taken into account.

*"Austrians tend to be direct communicators, and don't usually “beat around the bush.” 
They prefer speaking honestly and clearly to arrive at a point. 
At first, they may appear reserved and value modesty in most interactions."*

*"Frank friends are the best, as we say in France. 
Frankness is a gift. 
This is so strong in our culture that we welcome negative feedback and sometimes assess positive feedback as hypocritical. 
This character trait may turn into a handicap as we may hurt other culture’s sensitivities.
...
We’re not afraid of asking questions. 
We love to challenge the one who is speaking. 
Everything can be subject to debate and discussion. 
We are ready to challenge anything and everything.
...
Yet, debate is seen as a healthy process which will help to bring more ideas to the table. 
We welcome anyone who stimulates this energy in a discussion."*

Both Austrian and French people lean more towards the Dutch way of communicating rather than the Finnish way. 
Though it can be said that someone from Austria may at first glance lean more towards the Finnish way, with them apearing reserved.
When looking into these stereotypes, it becomes apparent why there hasn't been any hiccups with communication. 
Though it's true that most (or let's be honest, all) of our communication has been through two of the international students from the Finnish side.
When looking at the communication thus far, the basis of the stereotypes seems true. 

But there are also other dimensions to cultural differances besides cummunication. Well-known dimensions of cultural differences include those identified by Hofstede's cultural dimensions theory, the Seven Dimensions of Culture model, and other dimensions such as power distance, uncertainty avoidance, and gender egalitarianism. 
Power distance and gender eqalitarianism are not really relevant to our group project, because we were all at the same power level. And as the only female Dutch student, I haven't had the feeling I was being threated differently to the others. 
Uncertainty avoidance is also less relevant, because we were making major decisions together and smaller decisions were made after getting feedback from the rest of the team. Everyone was also very open to answering questions, so even if there was anything uncertain, you chould easily ask someone else.

### Ethics

Ethics in software engineering refers to the principles and values that guide the behavior of software engineers when designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. Ethical considerations in software engineering include fairness, honesty, nonmaleficence, and beneficence, and should be integrated into the software development lifecycle. The Software Engineering Code of Ethics provides a set of guidelines for software engineers to follow when making ethical decisions.

When talking about ethics for our application, you can talk about two different subject regarding ethics; 
ethics for programmers and ethics for consumers. 

Ethics for programmers is talking about ethical programming and is important to ensure that software engineers work responsibly and effectively, create products that are safe and respectful of human dignity, prioritize public safety, and meet ethical standards.

[link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11948-015-9665-x) ,
[researchgate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227991826_Software_Engineering_Ethics)

Ethics for consumers is talking about ethical problems or questions brought up by our product. 
Our application is meant for people searching for animals or a new home for their animals. 
Either way the animals will be put on the website. 
Some might have a problem with this, as it can be interpreted as making the animals more like products, instead of living breathing organisms. 
The point to consider is that we as creators of the website aren’t making new ethical dilemma’s as other sites also list their available animals as “products”. 
That is why we have listings with personal information about each animal individually, to make it more ethical, instead of listings just about species, age, breed, etc.

A software engineer has to think about the ethics of their work, therefore they have to engage in deliberations about ethics and familiarize themself with the code of ethics. 
The most important thing is to make ethics a common topic and to be mindfull of the etics surrounding your work. 
A software engineer has to communicate about ethical aspects regarding their work. 
When they are familiar with the code of ethics, they can discuss this with other software engineers to get feedback.

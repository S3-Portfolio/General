### Cultural differences
In regards to our group project there is a clear subject of cultural differences between the Dutch and Finnish students. 

And even within the Finnish group there are multiple cultures. 

This can have consequences for communication or decision making within the group. 

*“The Dutch are frank, blunt, no-nonsense people. 
They won’t pretend to like something just because they think it might offend you. 
On the one hand, it is very “refreshing”, as you will know exactly where you stand — but it can also come as a bit of a shock. 
It might seem a little harsh at first, but you should get used to it if you plan to spend any amount of time in the Netherlands.”*

*“Dutch Stubborness – There’s no more stoic people than the Dutch. 
… If a Dutchman has set his (or her) mind to something, it’s going to happen 
… refuse to accept common morality/ethics as the rest of the world and (thankfully!) stick to their own (gay marriage, soft drugs and so forth); 
most importantly – have you ever fought a Dutchman on any kind of issue they disagree with? 
It’s not just the frankness, you’d need a gun if not bigger to convince a Dutchie they’re wrong…”*

*“Finns have a reputation for reticence, thoughtfulness and unemotional behavior. 
They are quiet, reflective, somber and, for some, seemingly stubborn and standoffish. 
They are unwilling to speak unless they have something of importance to say. 
There is a saying that when a Finn says something, they really mean it.”*

From these citations it is apparent that Dutch people are stereotypically described as blunt and stubborn and Finnish people as quiet and standoffish. 
Of course most people are different and fall outside their stereotypes, but stereotypes established themselves for a reason. 

When only taking into account the stereotypes, it seems that there will not be a lot of conflict between groups; 
with the Dutch being blunt and pushing their ideas through and the Finnish quietly agreeing letting it all happen. 
But this should not be expected. 
Everyone is different and if we really are conforming to our stereotypes, than the Dutch should be more assertive towards the Finnish; 
ask their opinion, giving them time and a place to speak their mind. 
And the Finnish should be more vocal towards the Dutch. 

It should be stated that we have not encountered any problems (yet) with communication or decision making with the Finnish group and we hope it will stay this way throughout this project. 

### Ethics
When talking about ethics for our application, you can talk about two different subject regarding ethics; 
ethics for programmers and ethics for consumers. 

Ethics for programmers is talking about ethical programming.

Ethics for consumers is talking about ethical problems or questions brought up by our product. 
Our application is meant for people searching for animals or a new home for their animals. 
Either way the animals will be put on the website. 
Some might have a problem with this, as it can be interpreted as making the animals more like products, instead of living breathing organisms. 
The point to consider is that we as creators of the website aren’t making new ethical dilemma’s as other sites also list their available animals as “products”. 
That is why we have listings with personal information about each animal individually, to make it more ethical, instead of listings just about species, age, breed, etc.

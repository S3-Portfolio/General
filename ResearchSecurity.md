# Research
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Introduction
My application is a website for divers to get an overview of diving locations and fish. Have an interactive world map that shows diving locations that are clickable. When clicked show information about dive and fish at that location. Have a search function for both dives and fish. Dive listing shows information about that dive and which fish a diver would be able to see when taking that dive. Fish listing shows information about that fish and which diving locations a diver would be able to see that fish at.

## Bonus
### Comparing AI generated answer to my research
I give the AI my general idea of my website and my user stories and asked it to write me a research paper about which security concers my application has. Keep in mind that I give it all my User Stories, including the ones I haven't finished / started. This means that the AI could give a different answer than I would need at the moment.

#### My question
*"My application is a website for divers to get an overview of diving locations and fish. Has an interactive world map that shows diving locations that are clickable. When clicked show information about dive and fish at that location. Have a search function for both dives and fish. Dive listing shows information about that dive and which fish a diver would be able to see when taking that dive. Fish listing shows information about that fish and which diving locations a diver would be able to see that fish at.*

*My user stories:*

* *As a diver I want to see on a world map where diving locations are.*
* *As a diver I want to be able to click on a diving location to see wich fish are in that location.*
* *As a diver I want to know which diving locations I can see a specific fish at, because a diver wants to know where they could be able to see a certain fish.*
* *As a diver/user I want to be able to add information to the website, because this broadens the informaton on the website.*
* *As a admin I want to be able to see which users added which information, because than the admin can flag users spreading misinformation.*
* *As a admin I want to be able to ban users from editing information, because a user could add information that is nonsensicle.*
* *As a diver I want to be able to search for specific fish, because a diver wants to know more information about a fish.*
* *As a diver I want to see which fish I can see per dive.*
* *As a diver I want to be able to search for specific dives.*

*Can you write me a research paper about which security concerns my application has?"*

#### AI generated answer
*"As a website for divers to get an overview of diving locations and fish, your application has some security concerns to consider. The following are some potential issues to keep in mind:*

*User-generated content: Your website allows users to add information. While this can be a great way to broaden the information on the site, it can also lead to security concerns. For example, users may add misinformation, or they may post defamatory or offensive content. To mitigate these risks, you should have clear terms and conditions that outline what is and is not acceptable content on the site. You should also have a report function that allows users to flag inappropriate content, and you should be prepared to remove content that violates your policies.
Copyright: When users add content to your site, they may inadvertently or intentionally violate copyright laws. To protect your site, you should have clear policies about copyright infringement. For example, you should explain how users can make a DMCA request if they believe their content has been infringed upon. You should also include a copyright clause in your terms and conditions that prohibits users from sharing copyrighted material on your site.
Privacy: Your site may collect personal information from users, such as their name and email address. To protect this information, you should have a privacy policy that explains how you collect, use, and share user data. You should also explain how users can amend or delete their information, and you should make sure that any cloud storage provider you use has appropriate privacy protocols in place.
Acceptable use: Your site should have an acceptable use policy that outlines what types of usage are allowed and what is prohibited. For example, you may want to prohibit users from posting offensive or defamatory content, or from using the site in an abusive manner. You should also include a clause in your terms and conditions that allows you to terminate the account of any user who breaches your policies.
Security: Your site should be secure to prevent unauthorized access to user data or other sensitive information. This may include using encryption, secure authentication methods, and other security measures to protect your site from cyber attacks. You may also want to consider using a trusted third-party security provider to help you identify and mitigate potential security risks.

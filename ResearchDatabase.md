#### questions
Which type of database suits my application best?
- What is my application?

My application is a website for divers to get an overview of diving locations and fish. Have an interactive world map that shows diving locations that are clickable. When clicked show information about dive and fish at that location. Have a search function for both dives and fish. Dive listing shows information about that dive and which fish a diver would be able to see when taking that dive. Fish listing shows information about that fish and which diving locations a diver would be able to see that fish at.

- Which types are most popular / used?
#### [Types of databases](https://www.mongodb.com/databases/types)

From the source we can gather that there are a lot of different types of databases, but the most used are: Hierarchical, Relational, Non-Relational and Object oriented databases.

- Why are these most popular / used?

The hierarchical database is like a family tree and offers high performance, as there’s easy access and a quick querying time.
The relational database stores data in discrete tables.
The non-relational database matured due to increasingly complex modern web applications.
The object oriented databases are unique because associations between objects can persist. This means that object oriented programming and the querying of data across complex relationships is fast and powerful.

- What is SQL and noSQL?

NoSQL is an umbrella term for any alternative system to traditional SQL databases. Sometimes, when we say NoSQL management systems, we mean any database that doesn't use a relational model.
There are four kinds of this database: document databases, key-value stores, column-oriented databases, and graph databases.

- When do you use an SQL or noSQL database?
